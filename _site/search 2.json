I completed my B.A. at the University of Colorado in 2015 where I looked into the diversity of aberrant plants in the Purgatory watershed using phylogenetic tools in the Tripp Lab.\n\nContact Me\nGoogle ScholarResearchGateGitHubOrcidEmail\n\n\n\n",

Molecular phylogenetic studies suggest that Cyrtandra colonized the Hawaii shortly after its formation approximately 4.7mya, and then colonized younger islands through a stepping-stone model of dispersal, much like many other groups of flowering plants on Hawaii (the Silverswords, Psychotria, Hawaiian lobeliads, Schiedea, Silene, and Hesperomannia to name a few). As of this study, 60 species of Hawaiian Cyrtandra were recognized primarily on the basis of morphology. However, despite numerous attempts, morphological and molecular studies have not been able to resolve relationships for this group. Furthermore, complex evolutionary processes of hybridization and introgression, incomplete lineage sorting, and convergence are likely to play a role in the evolutionary history of Hawaiian Cyrtandra, contributing to further difficulty in resolving species relationships (see figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: From our paper in JSE, a plate highlighting the morphological diversity of Hawaiian Cyrtandra\n\n\n\nIn our study, we utilized targeted enrichment, high-throughput sequencing, and modern phylogenomics tools to test a subset of Hawaiian Cyrtandra species and putative hybrids for species relationships and hybridization. We found high levels of incongruence between our concatenated-tree and species-tree, indicating high levels of incomplete lineage sorting. Our species-tree was well resolved and supported previous hypotheses of a stepping-stone model of dispersal from older to newer islands, along with some back-dispersals to older islands. Tests for introgression and hybridization showed gene flow between taxa, though not always the taxa we expected. This suggests that hybridization does play a role in this group of flowers, but a study incorporating more putative species and hybrids is necessary to better understand how hybridization has shaped the relationships within this group.\nPlant Diversity in the Purgatory Watershed2\nThe Purgatory Watershed in southeastern Colorado and northeastern New Mexico is a region composed of deep canyons, eroded mesas, and extensive intact shortgrass plains, and is located at the crossroads of biodiversity of the Rocky Mountains, Great Plains, and Chihuahuan Desert. Despite a lack of biological research in the area, it is home to a number of unique land formations (see figure 2) and endemic organisms. Prompted by herbarium and field observations of morphologically aberrant forms of a number of plant species from this region, we conducted a study comparing morphometric and genetic data of plant populations from within the Purgatory to populations of those same species found outside of the Purgatory.\nThe two species of plant we looked at were Amorpha nana, a perennial shrub found in prairies and hillsides across midwestern North America, and Tetraneuris acaulis, a perennial herb found in open, dry hillsides and plains across western North America. However, in the Purgatory, there are morphologically aberrant populations of these plants. We collected morphometric and genetic data from a number of individuals across the ranges of each species, and compared those data to the morphometric and genetic data from individuals of Purgatory populations. We found no difference between Purgatory and non-Purgatory populations of Tetraneuris acaulis, but there were clear differences (both morphologically and genetically) between the Purgatory and non-Purgatory populations of Amorpha nana. While this study alone is insufficient for making claims that the Purgatory is a region of neo-endemism, the lack of research on the area makes the Purgatory a compelling location of interest for future biodiversity studies.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A drainage of the Purgatory River. At the crossroads of the Rocky Mountains, Great Plains, and Chihuahuan Desert, the Purgatory Watershed hosts an eclectic mix of organisms.\n\n\n\n\nKleinkopf, J.A., W.R. Roberts, W.H. Wagner, E.H.
