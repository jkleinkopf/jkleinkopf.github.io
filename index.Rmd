I am a PhD student in the [Marx Lab](https://hannahmarx.com) at the University of New Mexico, interested in the ecology and evolution of flowering plants in island and alpine systems.

Prior to beginning my PhD work in 2021, I earned my M.Ed. and teaching credentials at UMass-Boston through the Boston Teacher Residency in 2019 and taught 6th grade earth and space science in Olympia, WA.

Before teaching, I earned my M.S. in plant sciences at Washington State University in the [Roalson Lab](https://labs.wsu.edu/roalson/) in 2018, where I used high-throughput sequencing and species tree analyses to better understand relationships between species of Hawaiian Cyrtandra. I completed my B.A. at the University of Colorado in 2015 where I looked into the diversity of aberrant plants in the Purgatory watershed using phylogenetic tools in the [Tripp Lab](https://trippreport.com).
