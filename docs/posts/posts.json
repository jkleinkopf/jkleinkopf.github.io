We’ll see how it goes… but here’s to hoping it keeps me on track with my research!\nYou can find a little bit more information about me on the About page, and a little bit more about my research on the Research page. Once the lab gets going, I will be writing a little bit more about the work I do (both wet lab work, and field work) here on this page. I might also post an analysis or two, or general thoughts on the state of sciences and museums.\nIn the meantime, here is a picture of my dog Charlie getting ready for spooky season. She’s a year and a half (as of September 2021) and still has the energy of a puppy. I don’t love candy corn but I will make an exception this one time ;).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
