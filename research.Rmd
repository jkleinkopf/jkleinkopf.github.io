### Diversification of Hawaiian Cyrtandra^[Kleinkopf, J.A., W.R. Roberts, W.H. Wagner, E.H. Roalson. 2019. _Diversification of Hawaiian_ Cyrtandra _(Gesneriaceae) under the influence of incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization._ Journal of Systematics and Evolution. 57(6). DOI: 10.1111/jse.12519]
_Cyrtandra_ (Gesneriaceae) is an Old-World genus of flowering plants comprised of over 800 species distributed throughout Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, including the Hawaiian Islands. Molecular phylogenetic studies suggest that _Cyrtandra_ colonized the Hawaii shortly after its formation approximately 4.7mya, and then colonized younger islands through a stepping-stone model of dispersal, much like many other groups of flowering plants on Hawaii (the Silverswords, _Psychotria_, Hawaiian lobeliads, _Schiedea_, _Silene_, and _Hesperomannia_ to name a few). As of this study, 60 species of Hawaiian _Cyrtandra_ were recognized primarily on the basis of morphology. However, despite numerous attempts, morphological and molecular studies have not been able to resolve relationships for this group. Furthermore, complex evolutionary processes of hybridization and introgression, incomplete lineage sorting, and convergence are likely to play a role in the evolutionary history of Hawaiian _Cyrtandra_, contributing to further difficulty in resolving species relationships (see figure 1).

In our study, we utilized targeted enrichment, high-throughput sequencing, and modern phylogenomics tools to test a subset of Hawaiian _Cyrtandra_ species and putative hybrids for species relationships and hybridization. We found high levels of incongruence between our concatenated-tree and species-tree, indicating high levels of incomplete lineage sorting. Our species-tree was well resolved and supported previous hypotheses of a stepping-stone model of dispersal from older to newer islands, along with some back-dispersals to older islands. Tests for introgression and hybridization showed gene flow between taxa, though not always the taxa we expected. This suggests that hybridization does play a role in this group of flowers, but a study incorporating more putative species and hybrids is necessary to better understand how hybridization has shaped the relationships within this group.  

### Plant Diversity in the Purgatory Watershed^[Kleinkopf, J.A., D.A. Clark, and E.A. Tripp. 2017. _Aberrant Plant Diversity in the Purgatory Watershed of Southeastern Colorado and Northeastern New Mexico._ Western North American Naturalist. 77(3). DOI: 10.3398/064.077.0307]

The Purgatory Watershed in southeastern Colorado and northeastern New Mexico is a region composed of deep canyons, eroded mesas, and extensive intact shortgrass plains, and is located at the crossroads of biodiversity of the Rocky Mountains, Great Plains, and Chihuahuan Desert. Despite a lack of biological research in the area, it is home to a number of unique land formations (see figure 2) and endemic organisms. Prompted by herbarium and field observations of morphologically aberrant forms of a number of plant species from this region, we conducted a study comparing morphometric and genetic data of plant populations from within the Purgatory to populations of those same species found outside of the Purgatory.

The two species of plant we looked at were _Amorpha nana_, a perennial shrub found in prairies and hillsides across midwestern North America, and _Tetraneuris acaulis_, a perennial herb found in open, dry hillsides and plains across western North America. However, in the Purgatory, there are morphologically aberrant populations of these plants. We collected morphometric and genetic data from a number of individuals across the ranges of each species, and compared those data to the morphometric and genetic data from individuals of Purgatory populations. We found no difference between Purgatory and non-Purgatory populations of _Tetraneuris acaulis_, but there were clear differences (both morphologically and genetically) between the Purgatory and non-Purgatory populations of _Amorpha nana_. While this study alone is insufficient for making claims that the Purgatory is a region of neo-endemism, the lack of research on the area makes the Purgatory a compelling location of interest for future biodiversity studies.
